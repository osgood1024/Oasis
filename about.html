      In 2018, we started Oasis to disrupt the overpriced and outdated models of the event industry.
       Empowered by the people through crowdfunding, our original website set us apart by bringing you quality, minimalist designs at radically fair prices.

       <br  />

       Through social media we grew far beyond our San Diego home, becoming a global community of 1.5 million oasis owners (and counting).

       <br  />
  We’re inspired by the go-getters, the innovators, the dreamers; and our mission embody this very spirit. They’re built for adventuring, creating, and daring to disrupt the norm.

  <br />
  Above all else, we create with the dream of enlivening our ultimate mission: to inspire you to live life on your own terms.
